<CollapsibleResumeItem title="Profile" :justify="true">

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience building and operating complex, customer-facing systems across startup and enterprise environments. Over the last four years, I've worked continuously on the same product, a quantum-as-a-service platform, carrying end-to-end responsibility from product discovery and system architecture through implementation, automated deployment, and production operations. In this context, I've designed and evolved both system-level and code-level architectures, applying proven patterns for distributed and loosely coupled systems to support long-term maintainability and change tolerance. Beyond the core platform, I regularly contribute by shaping architectural direction and operational practices across multiple product streams.

I enjoy working at the intersection of product and engineering, especially in early-stage, fast-moving environments where requirements are incomplete and engineers are trusted to define scope, make trade-offs, and ship. My work spans the full lifecycle: collaborating on problem definition, implementing customer-facing features, designing backend services and data models, and establishing CI/CD and GitOps workflows. I place strong emphasis on clear architectural boundaries and sustainable design, using principles such as Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture to enable systems to evolve over time.

I've worked closely with customers, sales, and business stakeholders, and regularly use monitoring and usage data to guide technical and product decisions. Technically, I'm strongest in TypeScript (Vue.js, React, Node.js), Java (Spring Boot), Python, and PostgreSQL, with deep experience building cloud-native systems on Kubernetes and public cloud platforms (GCP, AWS, Azure). I'm motivated by roles where engineers carry responsibility from initial design through production operation and long-term maintenance.

## Experience

<ResumeItem title="Senior Software Engineer, Product & Platform" subtitle="Kipu Quantum GmbH - Full-Time" start="05/2024" end="Present" location="Karlsruhe, Germany - Remote">

> Seed-stage deep-tech startup; continuation of the PLANQK Platform following acquisition from Anaqor; same product, team, and codebase

- Led the continued end-to-end development of a production quantum-as-a-service platform, enabling customers to build, run, and integrate quantum applications via standardized APIs and SDKs.
- Carried responsibility for system architecture and technical direction, alongside frontend and backend development, automated GitOps-based deployment, and production operations on Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- Defined and evolved the platform's system and code architecture, applying proven patterns for distributed and loosely coupled systems as well as Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture principles to ensure long-term maintainability and change tolerance.
- Shaped system and code-level architecture across multiple product streams beyond the core platform, advising teams on architectural direction, operational setup, and long-term maintainability.
- Designed and evolved backend services and data models using Java (Spring Boot) and PostgreSQL, iterating on them based on production behavior, reliability issues, and scaling needs.
- Defined and implemented customer-facing features and flows in TypeScript (UI, CLI) and Python (SDK), translating direct customer feedback and usage data into concrete UX and functional improvements.
- Established and maintained CI/CD and GitOps workflows and operated the platform in production, using monitoring and incident analysis (Datadog, Grafana, Loki) to enable frequent, low-risk releases and drive continuous improvements in reliability, usability, and developer experience.
- Supported onboarding of enterprise customers who actively run experiments or consume quantum services through the platform.

<ResumeItem title="Senior Software Engineer, Product & Platform" subtitle="Anaqor - Full-Time" start="07/2021" end="04/2024" location="Berlin, Germany - Remote">

> Pre-seed startup

- Joined at an early stage to help evolve the PLANQK Platform from a research prototype into a commercial, publicly available quantum-as-a-service offering.
- Took responsibility for core architectural decisions, designing a modular and loosely coupled platform and establishing clear service and domain boundaries using Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture principles.
- Built customer-facing functionality and APIs, working closely with early users to refine workflows and platform behavior based on real-world usage.
- Designed and iterated on cloud-native deployment and operational architectures on Kubernetes, laying the foundation for reliable and scalable production usage.
- Integrated multiple quantum hardware providers behind a unified API and Python SDK, balancing abstraction with performance and provider-specific constraints.
- Collaborated closely with product, business, and research stakeholders to define scope, make trade-offs, and ship features in a fast-moving startup environment.
